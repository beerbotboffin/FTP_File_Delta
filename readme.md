# FTP File Delta  

## Project Description  
I wrote this tool for when developing on a local machine (where you have proper dev tools) but you needed to transfer files to a server via SFTP. 

## How to use  
Should be pretty straightforward, just edit the config.json.example file (remove .example), change to suit your environment. After modifying whatever files you're working on, run the script - 
it will detect files which have changed and upload via SFTP to the sever.  

## Built With  
- Python 3.10  

## Future updates  
- [ ] Error Handling
